1. Variable.

Named memory area which can be used to access (keep track, hold) the data. Data that in Variable is called VALUE.
In other words, variable is a bucket (named memory area), that can hold water (data). 
As you noticed, it's NAMED. So, it must have a name. 
Name of the variable is up to us and it should represent the piece of data tha we want to hold.
Name must be a one word, we can use dollar sign letter or numbers and underline, and can't start with the number.

2. Data types.

When we have named variable, but haven't give value yet, the variable is UNDEFINED.

we start with var , then give a name to it, and then value can be set after the equal sign (operator):

var number = 200; - NUMBER (integer or fractional, for arithmetic operations)
var name = "Hoi Hoi";  - STRING (in single or double quotes, but don't mix them)
var bull = false; - BULLIAN (for verifications in decision-making)
var bull = true; - BULLIAN



3. Arithmetic operators.
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ devision

var a = 200;
var b = 10;
var result = 200-10


4. Logical operators

&&
||
!


5. Relational operators


> greater than
< less that
== equal
!= not equal
>= greaterthan or equal
<= less than or equal


var sum = 260 ;
var change = 0.2 , 0.8, 0.18 ;

console.log(sum <= 250 && (change == "0.2" || change == "0.8" || change == "0.88"));
